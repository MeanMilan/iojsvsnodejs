## The node js foundation

* Open governance (finally)
* Big names involved ( IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Fidelity, The Linux Foundation)

* It is split in 
    - Foundation board: marketing, fundraising, events, legal
    - Technical Committee: codebase management, builds, technical stuff

* The TC won't take any technical directions for the board
* TC members will be elected for their merit

* OK, cool, BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO?
