## So what is io.js?

It's a friendly fork of [joyent/node](https://github.com/joyent/node)

Friendly means:

* It is compatible with the npm ecosystem
* It is an opportunity to core node member to rapidly improve node
* Goal is to eventually merge iojs back to Node, once governance and release cycle issue are solved
